<h1>Data Analysis on Cryptocurrency Prices</h1>
<p>Looking for insights from the top cryptocurrencies. The dataset was acquired by the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" target="_blank"><b>CoinGecko Exchange</b></a>. This is a good start to display the flexibility of using Javascript version of Plotly (Plotly.js). Plotly.js allows you to display charts in web2 website that can be updated quickly. I plan to look for the highest valued and lowest valued cryptocurrenices. I'm also planning to look for the cryptocurrencies with highest and lowest price value within 24 hours. Thank you for taking a look at charts created with Javascript.</p>
